# ArduinoParkingProject
Project is made with:
1. Arduino Uno microcontroller,
2. RFID,
3. Ultrasonic Sensor,
4. 16x2 LCD,
5. Servo Motor,
Potentiometer and some Led's.

The primary goal of this project was to understand how these sensors and actuators works, as well as how they are programmed.
The project is called Parking Project because through the combination of these devices and their programming we have come to the concept of how a praking in real life could have functioned.
